# Stock_Price_Alert
You are tasked with building a web application that allows users to receive notifications when
the price of a given stock reaches a certain threshold. The application should allow users to
enter a stock ticker symbol and a price threshold, and it should send a notification (e.g. an email
or a text message) to the user when the stock&#39;s price reaches or exceeds the threshold.

In addition to the above requirements, your application should also have the following features:
- A feature that allows users to specify the frequency at which the stock&#39;s price should be
checked (e.g. every hour, every day, etc.)
- A feature that allows users to specify the type of notification they would like to receive (e.g.
email, text message, etc.)
To complete this challenge, you should create a web application using Python and the Flask
web framework. The application should have a user-friendly interface and should be able to
retrieve and process the required stock data in a clear and concise manner.
